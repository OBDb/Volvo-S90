    description: "The modern Volvo S90, introduced in 2016, represents Volvo's flagship luxury sedan and a key component of the brand's upmarket repositioning under Geely ownership. Built on the Scalable Product Architecture (SPA) platform shared with the XC90 SUV and V90 wagon, the S90 features distinctive Scandinavian design with clean lines, elegant proportions, and signature Thor's Hammer LED headlights. The interior showcases premium materials including wood, leather, and metal accents, centered around a 9-inch portrait-oriented Sensus touchscreen that controls most vehicle functions. Initially launched with a range of Drive-E four-cylinder engines, including turbocharged T5, turbo- and supercharged T6, and plug-in hybrid T8 twin-engine variants with up to 400 combined horsepower, Volvo later simplified the powertrain lineup with an increased focus on electrification. A 2020 facelift brought subtle design updates, new technology features, and a switch to mild-hybrid powertrains across most of the range. Advanced safety and driver assistance systems are comprehensive, including Pilot Assist semi-autonomous driving capability, City Safety collision avoidance, and numerous other features that continue Volvo's safety leadership. The S90 Excellence, offered in select markets, provides an ultra-luxury experience with a four-seat configuration featuring exceptional rear-seat amenities. The modern S90 successfully positions Volvo as a distinctive alternative to established German luxury brands, offering a uniquely Scandinavian interpretation of premium automotive design and technology."
